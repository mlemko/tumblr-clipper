# Tumblr Clipper
Tumblr Clipper is an application that automatically converts Tumblr app links (*yuck!*) to regular Tumblr links. It removes all the tracking on the link, and additionally makes them embeddable on various chat apps (Discord, Telegram, etc.).

## Issues
- As of right now, the app breaks links generated from original posts. Reblogs work fine, however.

## Example
When sharing links to other apps, select the `Tumblr Clipper` app and a new sharescreen will open with the new link.

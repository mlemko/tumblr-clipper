# Tumblr Clipper
Tumblr Clipper is an application that automatically converts Tumblr app links (*yuck!*) to regular Tumblr links. It removes all the tracking on the link, and additionally makes them embeddable on various chat apps (Discord, Telegram, etc.). May break a few links (I don't know how to determine them, sorry!)

## Example
When sharing links to other apps, select the `Tumblr Clipper` app and a new sharescreen will open with the new link.
```{url}
https://at.tumblr.com/staff/hello-esteemed-important-internet-people-you/rlpbkxtmvi5q
```
will be converted into
```{url}
https://tumblr.com/staff/hello-esteemed-important-internet-people-you/
```
